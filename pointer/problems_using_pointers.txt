There may be problems due to pointers :- (you may get run time error)
 i>  unintialized pointers
 ii>  Memory leak
 iii> Dangling pointers
  
  iii. DANGLING POINTER:- If we give the address to any external function , and if that external function delete that pointer . And if we try to access it in main function then compiler will show run time error. This is the concept of dangling pointers./
  syntax:- 
   void fun(*q) 
   {
    -----
    -----
    delete []q;
   }
   void main()
   {
    int *p=new int[5];
    -----
    -----
    fun(p);
    cout<<*p;
    return 0;
   }
